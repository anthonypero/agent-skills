# Commit Messages

Follow standard conventional commits or the user's preferred simple style:

- `feat: ...`
- `fix: ...`
- `docs: ...`
- `chore: ...`

## Trailers

Do NOT append a `Co-Authored-By` line or any other AI attribution trailer to commit messages. Keep commits clean with only the message itself.
